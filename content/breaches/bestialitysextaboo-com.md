In March 2018, the animal bestiality website known as <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/evqvpz/bestiality-website-hacked-troy-hunt-have-i-been-pwned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bestialitysextaboo was hacked</a>. A collection of various sites running on the same service were also compromised and details of the hack (including links to the data) were posted on a popular forum. In all, more than 3.2k unique email addresses were included alongside usernames, IP addresses, dates of birth, genders and bcrypt hashes of passwords.
