In September 2015, the non-consensual voyeurism site <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/upskirt-porn-website-hit-massive-data-leak-exposing-nearly-180000-voyeurs-1602756" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&quot;The Candid Board&quot; suffered a data breach</a>. The hack of the vBulletin forum led to the exposure of over 178k accounts along with email and IP addresses, dates of birth and salted passwords hashed with MD5.
