In June 2020, the interior design website <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-leaks-386-million-user-records-from-18-companies-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Havenly suffered a data breach</a> which impacted almost 1.4 million members of the service. The exposed data included email addresses, names, phone numbers, geographic locations and passwords stored as SHA-1 hashes, all of which was subsequently shared extensively throughout online hacking communities.
