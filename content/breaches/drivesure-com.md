In December 2020, the car dealership service provider <a href="https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2021/02/01/personal-data-of-3-million-people-exposed-in-drivesure-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DriveSure suffered a data breach</a>. The incident resulted in 26GB of data being downloaded and later shared on a hacking forum. Impacted personal information included 3.6 million unique email addresses, names, phone numbers and physical addresses. Vehicle data was also exposed and included makes, models, VIN numbers and odometer readings. A small number of passwords stored as bcrypt hashes were also included in the data set.
