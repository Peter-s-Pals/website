In April 2021, the market research surveys company <a href="https://www.clearvoicesurveys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClearVoice Surveys</a> had a publicly facing database backup from 2015 taken and redistributed on a popular hacking forum. The data included 15M unique email addresses across more than 17M rows of data that also included names, physical and IP addresses, genders, dates of birth and plain text passwords. ClearVoice Surveys advised they were aware of the breach and confirmed its authenticity.
