In December 2018, the video messaging service <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/11/620_million_hacked_accounts_dark_web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dubsmash suffered a data breach</a>. The incident exposed 162 million unique email addresses alongside usernames and PBKDF2 password hashes. In 2019, the data appeared listed for sale on a dark web marketplace (along with several other large breaches) and subsequently began circulating more broadly.
