In July 2015, the Cydia repository known as <a href="https://myrepospace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myRepoSpace</a> was hacked and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3c9qr1/discussion_myrepospace_user_data_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user data leaked publicly</a>. Cydia is designed to facilitate the installation of apps on jailbroken iOS devices. The repository service was allegedly hacked by <a href="https://twitter.com/its_not_herpes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@its_not_herpes</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/0x8badfl00d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">0x8badfl00d</a> in retaliation for the service refusing to remove pirated tweaks.
