In mid-2016, the telephone and address directory service <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/11/620_million_hacked_accounts_dark_web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whitepages was among a raft of sites that were breached and their data then sold in early-2019</a>. The data included over 11 million unique email addresses alongside names and passwords stored as either a SHA-1 or bcrypt hash. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it to be attributed to &quot;BenjaminBlue@exploit.im&quot;.
