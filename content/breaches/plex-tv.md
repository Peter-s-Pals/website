In July 2015, the discussion forum for Plex media centre <a href="https://blog.plex.tv/2015/07/02/security-notice-forum-user-password-resets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was hacked and over 327k accounts exposed</a>. The IP.Board forum included IP addresses and passwords stored as salted hashes using a weak implementation enabling many to be rapidly cracked.
