In May 2018, the website for the ticket distribution service <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbk3nx/ticketfly-website-database-hacked-data-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ticketfly was defaced by an attacker and was subsequently taken offline</a>. The attacker allegedly requested a ransom to share details of the vulnerability with Ticketfly but did not receive a reply and subsequently posted the breached data online to a publicly accessible location. The data included over 26 million unique email addresses along with names, physical addresses and phone numbers. Whilst there were no passwords in the publicly leaked data, <a href="https://support.ticketfly.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2941983-ticketfly-cyber-incident-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ticketfly later issued an incident update</a> and stated that &quot;It is possible, however, that hashed values of password credentials could have been accessed&quot;.
