In mid-2015, the Dutch Minecraft site <a href="https://twitter.com/serverpact/status/772534083788365829" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ServerPact was hacked</a> and 73k accounts were exposed. Along with birth dates, email and IP addresses, the site also exposed SHA1 password hashes with the username as the salt.
