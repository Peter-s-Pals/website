In October 2015, the crowdfunding site <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/patreon-hacked-anonymous-patrons-exposed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon was hacked</a> and over 16GB of data was released publicly. The dump included almost 14GB of database records with more than 2.3M unique email addresses, millions of personal messages and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes.
