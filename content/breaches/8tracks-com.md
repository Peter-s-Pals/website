In June 2017, the online playlists service known as <a href="https://blog.8tracks.com/2017/06/27/password-security-alert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8Tracks suffered a data breach</a> which impacted 18 million accounts. In their disclosure, 8Tracks advised that &quot;the vector for the attack was an employeeâ€™s GitHub account, which was not secured using two-factor authentication&quot;. Salted SHA-1 password hashes for users who <em>didn't</em> sign up with either Google or Facebook authentication were also included.
