In January 2019, the travel and hotel booking site <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/hacker-strikes-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ixigo suffered a data breach</a>. The data appeared for sale on a dark web marketplace the following month and included over 17M unique email addresses alongside names, genders, phone numbers, connections to Facebook profiles and passwords stored as MD5 hashes. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it to be attributed to &quot;BenjaminBlue@exploit.im&quot;.
