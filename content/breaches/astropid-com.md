In December 2013, the vBulletin forum for the social engineering site known as "AstroPID" was breached and <a href="https://www.sinister.ly/Thread-40-Compromised-databases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked publicly</a>. The site provided tips on fraudulently obtaining goods and services, often by providing a legitimate "PID" or Product Information Description. The breach resulted in nearly 6k user accounts and over 220k private messages between forum members being exposed.
