In August 2020, the workout tracking app <a href="https://www.jefit.com/jefit-news-product-updates/jefit-data-incident-public-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jefit suffered a data breach</a>. The data was subsequently sold within the hacking community and included over 9 million email and IP addresses, usernames and passwords stored as either vBulletin or argon2 hashes. Several million cracked passwords later appeared in broad circulation.
