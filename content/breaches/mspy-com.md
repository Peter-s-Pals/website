In May 2015, the &quot;monitoring&quot; software known as <a href="http://www.mspy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mSpy</a> suffered a <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/05/mobile-spy-software-maker-mspy-hacked-customer-data-leaked/#more-30913" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major data breach</a>. The software (allegedly often used to spy on unsuspecting victims), stored extensive personal information within their online service which after being breached, was made freely available on the internet.
