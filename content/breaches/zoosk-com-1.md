In January 2020, the online dating service <a href="https://grahamcluley.com/zoosk-hacking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoosk suffered a data breach</a> which was subsequently shared extensively across online hacking communities. The breach contained 24 million unique email addresses alongside extensive personal information including genders, sexualities, dates of birth, physical attributes such as height and weight, religions, ethnicities and political views. The breach also allegedly exposed MD5 password hashes, although the data circulating in hacking circles had this field nulled out.
