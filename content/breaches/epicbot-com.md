In September 2019, the RuneScape bot provider <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/password-data-dumped-online-for-2-2-million-users-of-currency-and-gaming-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EpicBot suffered a data breach that impacted 817k subscribers</a>. Data from the breach was subsequently shared on a popular hacking forum and included usernames, email and IP addresses and passwords stored as either salted MD5 or bcrypt hashes. EpicBot did not respond when contacted about the incident.
