In mid-2011, the Russian instant messaging service known as <a href="http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/51118/data-breach/qip-data-breach.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QIP (Quiet Internet Pager) suffered a data breach</a>. The attack resulted in the disclosure of over 26 million unique accounts including email addresses and passwords with the data eventually appearing in public years later.
