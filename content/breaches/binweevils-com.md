In September 2014, the online game Bin Weevils suffered a data breach. Whilst originally stating that only usernames and passwords had been exposed, <a href="https://www.databreaches.net/data-from-2014-hack-of-childrens-online-game-bin-weevils-leaked-online-hacker-claims-20m-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a subsequent story on DataBreaches.net indicated that a more extensive set of personal attributes were impacted</a> (comments there also suggest the data may have come from a later breach). The data included almost 1.3m unique email addresses, genders, ages and plain text passwords.
