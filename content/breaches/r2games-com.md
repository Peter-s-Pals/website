In late 2015, the gaming website <a href="https://www.r2games.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R2Games</a> was hacked and more than 2.1M personal records disclosed. The vBulletin forum included IP addresses and passwords stored as salted hashes using a weak implementation enabling many to be rapidly cracked. A further 11M accounts were added to "Have I Been Pwned" in March 2016 and another 9M in July 2016 bringing the total to over 22M. R2Games has stated that "R2Games is safe and secured, and far from being hacked." when being questioned.
