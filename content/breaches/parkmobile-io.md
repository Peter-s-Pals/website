In March 2021, the mobile parking app service <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/parkmobile-breach-exposes-license-plate-data-mobile-numbers-of-21m-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ParkMobile suffered a data breach which exposed 21 million customers' personal data</a>. The impacted data included email addresses, names, phone numbers, vehicle licence plates and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes. The following month, the data appeared on a public hacking forum where it was extensively redistributed.
