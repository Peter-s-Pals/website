In December 2017, the website for purchasing Counter-Strike skins known as <a href="http://opencsgo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open CS:GO</a> (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) suffered a data breach (address since redirects to dropgun.com). The 10GB file contained an extensive amount of personal information including email and IP addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses and purchase histories. <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/streamlining-data-breach-disclosures-a-step-by-step-process" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Numerous attempts were made to contact Open CS:GO about the incident</a>, however no responses were received.
