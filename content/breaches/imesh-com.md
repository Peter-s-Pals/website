In September 2013, the media and file sharing client known as <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/imesh-hack-more-51-million-user-records-former-filesharing-site-sale-dark-web-1565185" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iMesh was hacked and approximately 50M accounts were exposed</a>. The data was later put up for sale on a dark market website in mid-2016 and included email and IP addresses, usernames and salted MD5 hashes.
