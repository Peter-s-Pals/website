In approximately March 2019, the online Brazilian travel agency <a href="https://cybleinc.com/2020/07/24/around-43-million-user-records-belonging-to-two-online-platforms-leaked-on-darknet-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hurb (formerly Hotel Urbano) suffered a data breach</a>. The data subsequently appeared online for download the following year and included over 20 million customer records with email and IP addresses, names, dates of birth, phone numbers and passwords stored as unsalted MD5 hashes.
