In approximately December 2016, the online service for World of Warcraft private servers <a href="https://www.warmane.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warmane</a> suffered a data breach. The incident exposed over 1.1M accounts including usernames, email addresses, dates of birth and salted MD5 password hashes. The data was subsequently extensively circulated online and was later provided to HIBP by whitehat security researcher and data analyst Adam Davies.
