In December 2020, the dental practice management service <a href="https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2021/02/19/dark-web-roundup-january-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MMG Fusion was the victim of a data breach</a> which exposed 2.6M unique email addresses. The data also included patient appointments, names, phone numbers, dates of birth, genders and physical addresses. A small number of records also included passwords stored as bcrypt hashes. It should also be noted that MMG Fusion has been caught lying about this breach being legitimate on numerous occasions to customers.
