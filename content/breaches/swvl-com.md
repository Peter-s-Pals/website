In June 2020, the Egyptian bus operator <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/egyptian-bus-operator-swvl-hit-by-data-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swvl suffered a data breach</a> which impacted over 4 million members of the service. The exposed data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, profile photos, partial credit card data (type and last 4 digits) and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes, all of which was subsequently shared extensively throughout online hacking communities. The data was provided to HIBP by <a href="https://breachbase.pw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breachbase.pw</a>.
