Some time prior to May 2016, <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/rosebuttboard-ip-board" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the forum known as &quot;Rosebutt Board&quot; was hacked</a> and 107k accounts were exposed. The self-described &quot;top one board for anal fisting, prolapse, huge insertions and rosebutt fans&quot; had email and IP addresses, usernames and weakly stored salted MD5 password hashes hacked from the IP.Board based forum.
