In July 2015, the infidelity website Ashley Madison <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/07/online-cheating-site-ashleymadison-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered a serious data breach</a>. The attackers threatened Ashley Madison with the full disclosure of the breach unless the service was shut down. One month later, the database was dumped including more than 30M unique email addresses.
