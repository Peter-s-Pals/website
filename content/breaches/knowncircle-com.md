In approximately April 2016, the &quot;marketing automation for agents and professional service providers&quot; company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020171534/https://knowncircle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnownCircle</a> had a large volume of data obtained by an external party. The data belonging to the now defunct service appeared in JSON format and contained gigabytes of data related to the real estate and insurance sectors. The personal data in the breach appears to have primarily been used for marketing purposes, including logs of emails sent and tracking of gift cards. A small number of passwords for KnownCircle staff were also present and were stored as bcrypt hashes.
