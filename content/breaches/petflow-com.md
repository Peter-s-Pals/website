In December 2017, the pet care delivery service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/hacker-strikes-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PetFlow suffered a data breach which consequently appeared for sale on a dark web marketplace</a>. Almost 1M accounts were impacted and exposed email addresses and passwords stored as unsalted MD5 hashes. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to &quot;nano@databases.pw&quot;.
