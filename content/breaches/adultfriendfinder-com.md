In October 2016, the adult entertainment company <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/adultfriendfinder-network-hack-exposes-secrets-of-412-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Friend Finder Networks suffered a massive data breach</a>. The incident impacted multiple separate online assets owned by the company, the largest of which was the Adult FriendFinder website alleged to be &quot;the world's largest sex &amp; swinger community&quot;. Exposed data included usernames, passwords stored as SHA-1 hashes and 170 million unique email addresses. This incident is separate to the 2015 data breach Adult FriendFinder also suffered.
