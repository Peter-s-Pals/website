In early 2013, <a href="https://staff.tumblr.com/post/144263069415/we-recently-learned-that-a-third-party-had" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tumblr suffered a data breach</a> which resulted in the exposure of over 65 million accounts. The data was later put up for sale on a dark market website and included email addresses and passwords stored as salted SHA1 hashes.
