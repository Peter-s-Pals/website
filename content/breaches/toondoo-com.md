In August 2019, the comic strip creation website <a href="https://www.zataz.com/6-000-000-de-donnees-personnelles-piratees-pour-le-site-toondoo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ToonDoo suffered a data breach</a>. The data was subsequently redistributed on a popular hacking forum in November where the personal information of over 6M subscribers was shared. Impacted data included email and IP addresses, usernames, genders, the location of the individual and salted password hashes.
