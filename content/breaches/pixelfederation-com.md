In December 2013, a <a href="http://www.cyberwarnews.info/2013/12/04/pixel-federation-hacked-38000-user-credentials-leaked" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breach of the web-based game community based in Slovakia</a> exposed over 38,000 accounts which were promptly posted online. The breach included email addresses and unsalted MD5 hashed passwords, many of which were easily converted back to plain text.
