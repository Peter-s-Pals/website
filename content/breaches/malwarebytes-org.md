In November 2014, the <a href="http://www.scmagazine.com/malwarebytes-forum-hacked/article/385187/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malwarebytes forum was hacked</a> and 111k member records were exposed. The IP.Board forum included email and IP addresses, birth dates and passwords stored as salted hashes using a weak implementation enabling many to be rapidly cracked.
