In December 2011, Norway's largest online sex shop hemmelig.com was <a href="http://www.dazzlepod.com/hemmelig/?page=93" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hacked by a collective calling themselves &quot;Team Appunity&quot;</a>. The attack exposed over 28,000 usernames and email addresses along with nicknames, gender, year of birth and unsalted MD5 password hashes.
