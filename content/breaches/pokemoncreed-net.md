In August 2014, the Pokémon RPG website <a href="http://pokemoncreed.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon Creed</a> was hacked after a dispute with rival site, <a href="http://pkmndusk.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon Dusk</a>. In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ramandeep.s.dehal/posts/749666358442465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on Facebook</a>, &quot;Cruz Dusk&quot; announced the hack then pasted the dumped MySQL database on <a href="http://pkmndusk.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pkmndusk.in</a>. The breached data included over 116k usernames, email addresses and plain text passwords.
