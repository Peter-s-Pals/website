In April 2021, the Spanish retailer <a href="https://thetechzone.online/cyberattack-on-phone-house-with-ransomware-and-possible-data-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phone House allegedly suffered a ransomware attack that also exposed significant volumes of customer data</a>. Attributed to the Babuk ransomware, a collection of data alleged to be a subset of a larger corpus was posted to a dark web site and contained 5.2M email addresses along with names, nationalities, genders, dates of birth, phone numbers and physical addresses. Phone House has been threatened with further releases if a ransom is not paid.
