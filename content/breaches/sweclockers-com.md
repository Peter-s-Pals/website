In early 2015, the Swedish tech news site <a href="http://www.sweclockers.com/nyhet/20800-sweclockers-drabbas-av-dataintrang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SweClockers was hacked</a> and 255k accounts were exposed. The attack led to the exposure of usernames, email addresses and salted hashes of passwords stored with a combination of MD5 and SHA512.
