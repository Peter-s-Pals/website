In June 2019, the hacking website <a href="https://void.to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Void.to</a> suffered a data breach. There were 95k unique email addresses spread across 86k forum users and other tables in the database. A rival hacking website claimed responsibility for breaching the MyBB based forum which disclosed email and IP addresses, usernames, private messages and passwords stored as either salted MD5 or bcrypt hashes.
