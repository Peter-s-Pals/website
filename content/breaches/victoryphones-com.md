In January 2017, the automated telephony services company <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/republican-polling-firm-hacked-exposing-donor-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victory Phones left a Mongo DB database publicly facing without a password</a>. Subsequently, 213GB of data was downloaded by an unauthorised party including names, addresses, phone numbers and over 166k unique email addresses.
