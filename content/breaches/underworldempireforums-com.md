In April 2017, <a href="http://underworldempireforums.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the vBulletin forum for the Underworld Empire game</a> suffered a data breach that exposed 429k accounts. The data was then posted to a hacking forum in mid-February 2018 where it was made available to download. The source data contained IP and email addresses, usernames and salted MD5 hashes.
