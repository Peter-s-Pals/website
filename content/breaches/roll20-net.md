In December 2018, the tabletop role-playing games website <a href="https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/7209691/roll20-security-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roll20 suffered a data breach</a>. Almost 4 million customers were impacted by the breach and had email and IP addresses, names, bcrypt hashes of passwords and the last 4 digits of credit cards exposed. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to &quot;JimScott.Sec@protonmail.com&quot;.
