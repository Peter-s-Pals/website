In early 2017, the forum for the gaming website <a href="http://www.csoonline.com/article/3192246/security/r2games-compromised-again-over-one-million-accounts-exposed.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R2 Games was hacked</a>. R2 had previously appeared on HIBP in 2015 after a prior incident. This one exposed over 1 million unique user accounts and corresponding MD5 password hashes with no salt.
