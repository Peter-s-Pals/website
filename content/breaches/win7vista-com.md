In September 2013, the <a href="http://www.win7vista.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Win7Vista</a> Windows forum (since renamed to the "Beyond Windows 9" forum) was hacked and later <a href="http://leak.sx/thread-186933" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had its internal database dumped</a>. The dump included over 200k membersâ€™ personal information and other internal data extracted from the forum.
