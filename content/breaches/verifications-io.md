In February 2019, the email address validation service <a href="https://securitydiscovery.com/800-million-emails-leaked-online-by-email-verification-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">verifications.io suffered a data breach</a>. Discovered by <a href="https://twitter.com/mayhemdayone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bob Diachenko</a>, the breach was due to the data being stored in a MongoDB instance left publicly facing without a password and resulted in 763 million unique email addresses being exposed. Many records within the data also included additional personal attributes such as names, phone numbers, IP addresses, dates of birth and genders. No passwords were included in the data.
